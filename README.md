## 📖 What is CalcpadCE?

CalcpadCE is an open-source tool for mathematical and engineering calculations.
Write your formulas in a simple, readable syntax and get beautifully rendered output with plots, diagrams, and formatted results — all in real time.
For Desktop, Web and Visual Studio Code.

This is a fork of the now [closed-source](#️-project-status--history) Calcpad 7.6.2 (March 2026).

🡒 **[View the Documentation](https://imartincei.github.io/CalcpadCE/)**

**Core Features:**

* **Advanced Mathematics:** Native support for real and complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and a comprehensive library of numerical methods (integration, differentiation, root finding, FFT).
* **Smart Unit Tracking:** Built-in support for SI, Imperial, and USCS units, plus the ability to define custom units.
* **Programmability:** Full control over your calculations using custom functions, macros, conditional logic, loops, and file I/O (CSV / Excel <img src="docs/media/excel.svg" alt="" height="20">).
* **Rich Documentation:** Seamlessly embed Markdown, HTML, CSS, and parametric SVG drawings directly alongside your code.
* **Professional Reporting:** Automatically generate interactive HTML input forms and export polished, heavily formatted reports to native Word <img src="docs/media/image11.png" alt="" height="20"> formulas or PDF <img src="docs/media/image10.png" alt="" height="20">.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Writing a CalcpadCE worksheet is as simple as typing math and adding comments.

### Code

```mathlab
' Calculate the volume of a cylinder
r = 5 cm
h = 12 cm
V = π * r^2 * h
V|dm^3
V|gal
```

### Output

## 🏛️ Project Status & History

Following a shift to a closed-source model by its original creator, the public GitHub repository for Calcpad was taken offline.

Our community stepped up to fork the project and continue its open-source development.
We restored the final open-source release to officially launch CalcpadCE as a free, community-driven continuation of the software.

Our goal is to ensure that a free, open-source version of this fantastic tool remains available, maintained, and continuously improved by the community.

## 🤝 Contributing

CalcpadCE is entirely maintained by volunteers, and we welcome contributions of all sizes!
Whether you want to fix a bug, add a new numerical method, or improve the documentation, we would love your help.

To get started, please check out the repository, build the project locally, and browse our open issues.
If you are planning a major feature, we recommend opening a Discussion first to coordinate with the maintainers.
